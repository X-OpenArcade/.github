# Xandr's OpenArcade
## A project aimed to make an arcade-like UI with games you can play.
Xandr's OpenArcade is an open-source, free-to-use, ad-free, and no tracking arcade GUI with games that are free to play, copy, download, redistribute, find secrets to, etc. and be forked to fully revamp the UI.  
The only rule: You must attribute the "Xandr's OpenArcade" project, which is done by using the included "Powered by X OpenArcade" watermark/logo image on your main page. If you grab the games:
- Court Fighters
- Corgi Care+
- Slots
- Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Guess the Number
- Memory
you must include the watermark/logo at the bottom. All other games/tools are made by others and aren't made by the project, letting you not include the watermark/logo there.
Thanks for playing!
